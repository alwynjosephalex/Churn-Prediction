# Churn-Prediction
Lu’s Communications has a huge problem with churn (loss of customers to competition). It is expensive to acquire new customers and therefore retaining existing customers is much more appealing.
Lu’s communications would like to use a targeted approach to identify in advance customers who are likely to churn, which can be then targeted with special programs or incentives. This approach can bring in a huge loss if churn predictions are inaccurate, as money would be wasted to incentivise customers who would have stayed anyway.
This repo contains the code for a ML-based solution to predict customers most likely to churn for Lu's Communications.
